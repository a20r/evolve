# Crossover
In genetic algorithms, crossover is a genetic operator used to vary the programming of a chromosome or chromosomes from one generation to the next. It is analogous to reproduction and biological crossover, upon which genetic algorithms are based. Cross over is a process of taking more than one parent solutions and producing a child solution from them.

## Function Summary

    int one_ptr_crossover(void **chromo_1, void **chromo_2, int index)
    void crossover(
            void **child_1,
            void **child_2,
            int index,
            int (*crossover_func)(void **chromo_1, void **chromo_2, int index),
            float crossover_prob
    )
    

### one_pt_crossover
A single crossover point on both chromosomes is selected with `index`. All data beyond that point in either chromosome is swapped between the two. The result is crossed overd chromosomes.

	Parameters:
		void **chromo_1
			Pointer to pointer pointing at chromosome 1
		
		void **chromo_2
			Pointer to pointer pointing at chromosome 1

    	int index
	    	Crossover pivot index
    	
	Returns:
		0 for success, -1 for failure

    	
    	
### crossover
Main crossover wrapper for different crossover methods.

	Parameters:
		void **child_1
			Pointer to pointer pointing at child_1
		
		void **child_2
			Pointer to pointer pointing at child_2

    	int index
    		Crossover pivot index
    
    	int (*crossover_func)(void **chromo_1, void **chromo_2, int index)
    		Pointer to crossover function
    	
    	float crossover_prob
    		Crossover probability
