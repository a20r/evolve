#evolve
evolve is a Gentic Algorithm implemented in C.

## Requirements

- [al](http://github.com/chutsu/al): Algorithm library in C
- [dstruct](http://github.com/chutsu/dstruct): Data structure library in C
- [munit](http://github.com/chutsu/munit): Unit testing macros for C
- [dbg](http://github.com/chutsu/dbg): Debugging macros for C
- `cmake` (version 2.6 and higher)

## Installation
#### Generate make files using `cmake`
First navigate into `evolve` root, and generate make files using `cmake` **Note: the dot '.' is important**!

    cd <path to evolve>
    cmake .  
    
where `<path to evolve>` is the path to `evolve`.

#### Install `evolve`
run:

    sudo make install  

to install `evolve` to `/usr/local/include` (default install directory). 

#### Unit tests
Additionally if you would like to compile the unit tests for `evolve` simply do: 
    
    make
    
unit tests will reside in the `bin` dir where you ran make.
